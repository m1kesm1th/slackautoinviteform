The plugin will work for any Slack site. Though was specifically designed for biohackspace.org.

Configuration requires an Admin account (or an api_token created by one), the ability to upload/configure plugins and also the access privileges to edit pages.

1. Download from git the zip file containing the php file. This isn't absolutely necessary but its Wordpress best practise.
The folder and the zip file should have the same name as the php file (in this case 'slackautoinviteform').

2. Create an API token in the Slack Administration pages. You'll need this shortly.

3. Go back to Wordpress and ensure the Slack Auto Invite Form Plugin is activated. 

4. Go to Settings, AutoInviteFormPlugin and enter in the Slack webpage and the API Token you just generated. Click Save Settings.

5. Go into the page where you want the Email text box to appear. Click Edit and add in the Form short code 
[slackautoinviteform].

6. Now when you view the page, there will be a form where people can add their email to be sent an invite.
